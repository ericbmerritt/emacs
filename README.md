My Emacs Setup
==============

This is my emacs setup, you can probably use it out of the box as long 
as you change the information in `preferences/user-info.el`. Two
things to make note of is that you will need to copy these files to 
`~/.emacsrc/` and then symlink `~/.emacs` to `~/.emacsrc/emacs-init` 

The other thing to take note of is that modes are expected to be
install via `package-list-packages`.
