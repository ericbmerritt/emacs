My Emacs Setup
==============

This is my emacs setup, you can probably use it out of the box as long
as you change the information in `preferences/user-info.el`. Two
things to make note of is that you will need to symlink `./emacs-init`
to `~/.emacs` and that this expected to go into a directory on your
box of `~/.emacsrc`.

The other thing to take note of is that modes are expected to be
install via `package-list-packages`.
