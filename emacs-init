;;;; Th idea of this .emacs file is that your customization will not
;;;; live in this file. They live in varias files in a '.emacsrc'
;;;; directory. This sets a few variables that may be used by your
;;;; customizations and then loads these customizations form those files.
;;;;
;;;; The subdirectories that this .emacs cares about are as follows.
;;;;
;;;; ~/.emacsrc/init - This is where anything that must be run first should be dropped
;;;; ~/.emacsrc/mode-start-files - This is where your per mode configuration goes.
;;;; ~/.emacsrc/preferences - These are where your non-mode specific customizations go
;;;;
;;;; It loads the mode-start-files directory first, then the preferences directory.
;;;; This allows the preferences to override anything set in the mode-start-files.
;;;;
;;;; If you have anything that absolutly must be run before anything else drop it init
;;;; directory.
